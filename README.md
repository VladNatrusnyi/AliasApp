**AliasApp** is a fun and interactive game app designed for playing Alias. The app allows players to create teams and select the difficulty level of words before starting the game.

## **Key Features:**

- **Team Creation and Difficulty Selection:**  
  Players can create teams and choose the word difficulty level (e.g., Quick Thinker, Word Master, Brain Buster) before starting the game. The app will then provide words to each team in turn.

    - Swipe **right** if the word is guessed correctly.
    - Swipe **left** if the word is not guessed.  
      Each round is timed, and the game continues until one team reaches the goal of correctly guessed words.

  Players can adjust several settings in the app, including:
    - **Round Timer:** Set the duration for each game round.
    - **Game Goal:** Define the number of words a team must guess correctly to win.
